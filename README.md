Project Motivation
In this project, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that represent the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. We also adopt supervised learning techniques on partitioned and labeled data to identify and predict if a sample from the population is a customer or not. Real-life data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, from which current insights are collected to provide accurate metrics. The goal of this project is to predict which segments of the population would most likely reach out to the company, after the reception of a corresponding mail order. The objectives in this project are achieved in three main parts:

1. Customer Segmentation Report
In this section, we use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model
Using a third party dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign, we use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
Maving chosen the best model, it is then deployed to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. The competition ranks the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer. Our model achieves an ROC score of 0.7981 with 0.002 difference from the first score, as on the competion site [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/leaderboard)

This repository consists of:
- A notebook containing a step by step interactive project description with the source code
- A helper function with all the modules necessary for smooth deployment of the notebook 
- An excel file provining a detailed descrition of each fearure and the categories
